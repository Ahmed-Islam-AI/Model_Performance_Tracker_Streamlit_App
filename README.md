# Machine Learning Model Performance Tracker App

## Overview

This Streamlit app allows users to classify three popular datasets—Iris, Wine, and Breast Cancer—using three different machine learning models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest. The app enables users to select a dataset, apply different models, and compare their performance to determine the most accurate model for each dataset.

## Features

- **Dataset Selection**: Choose from Iris, Wine, or Breast Cancer datasets.
- **Model Evaluation**: Apply and evaluate the performance of SVM, KNN, and Random Forest models.
- **Performance Comparison**: Compare accuracy scores of different models to identify the best-performing model for the selected dataset.

## Installation

To run this app locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
